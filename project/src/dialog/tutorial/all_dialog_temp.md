# Goblin Armies Script

## Player Enters

grizzle: Well, look who finally showed up! The runt of the litter! Don’t worry, we’ll whip you into shape in no time.
snark: Well, maybe... If they don't trip over their own feet first! Honestly, Grizzle, do we really have to babysit this one?
grizzle: Now, now, Snark. Everyone starts somewhere. Even this... uh... unique individual deserves a chance.
snark: Fine. But if they mess up, it’s on you. Now, let’s get this over with.
grizzle: Alright, runt. We’ve got a lot to cover. Pay attention and maybe, just maybe, you’ll survive.
grizzle: We’re in a bit of a pickle. Corrupted goblins are spreading like mold on old cheese. It’s your job to clean them up. Let’s start with the basics.

## Goblins render on screen

grizzle: See those goblins lazing around? They need some inspiration. Inspire them! They’ll follow you if you can muster some enthusiasm.
snark: Enthusiasm? This one? Hah! Just try not to bore them to death, runt.

## Goblins fall behind

grizzle: They’re falling behind. Looks like they need some more inspiration! Keep them on their toes!
snark: Yeah, if you can muster the courage. Don't let them fall out of line, runt!
grizzle: They seem to be dragging their feet. Give 'em another pep talk with ‘shift’. Speed ‘em up! Don't forget to keep inspiring them, or they might just start napping again.

## Throw goblins

grizzle: Now for the fun part! Throw your goblins! Aim for that scrap pile over there. It's like goblin bowling!
snark: Try not to get a gutter ball!... Think you can handle that without throwing out your back, runt?

## Collecting scrap

grizzle: Look, they're even collecting scrap! Well, you need some place to put all that shiny scrap.
snark: A base. You need a base. Don't hurt yourself.
grizzle: Build a base and the goblins will keep the scrap comin' in!

## Base Built

player: This base isn't just a place to store scrap. It's a foundation for our community to grow and thrive.
grizzle: Oh, you made us proud!
snark: Let's just say you're less of an embarrassment.
grizzle: And don't worry if they grumble. Goblins love a bit of grunt work!
snark: Hey, I don't see you doing any work, ya lazy dog!
player: Great work everyone! We can do this if we work together!

## Goblins start training

grizzle: Look at that! You’ve collected enough scrap. Now our base can start training new goblins.
snark: Finally! Some reinforcements. Let’s hope SOME GOBLIN knows what they're doing!
player: Every new goblin is a new opportunity. Let's welcome them and help them grow.

## See Corrupted Goblins

grizzle: Look! Corrupted goblins! Show them what you’ve got by throwing our goblins at them.
snark: Try not to flinch, runt. They can smell fear. And incompetence.

## Kill Corrupted Goblin

snark: You did it! Maybe I was wrong about you... Bwahahaha! I'm kidding, ya mutt! My belly button coulda taken out that corrupted goblin!
snark: Don't listen to him. He's just cranky.
player: Great job, everyone! Together, we will turn the tide! We must press on!
grizzle: Now, scout ahead and find their base. Lead your inspired goblins to victory!
snark: And if you get lost, don't let me catch you crying!

## See Enemy Base

grizzle: There it is! Bring down the enemy base by throwing our goblins at it. You’ve got this!
snark: Just aim properly. We don’t need goblins stuck in the ceiling again.
player: This is our moment. Let's work together and bring down that base!

## Destroy Enemy Base

grizzle: Not bad, runt! You might just make survive down here. Keep this up, and we might even start to respect you!
snark: Respect? Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. But yeah, you did okay. For a runt.
grizzle: Cheer up, Snark. Everyone loves an underdog story. Now, go out there and show those corrupted goblins who's boss!
player: Great work, everyone! We've taken back this land and we can do the same again and again until our homeland is free from corruption!
